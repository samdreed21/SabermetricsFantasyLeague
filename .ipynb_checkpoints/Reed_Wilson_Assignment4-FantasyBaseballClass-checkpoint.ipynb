You've heard about WAR and wOBA and replacement value and all sorts of ways to evaluate players, and now we're going to turn it into a competition with (fake) money on it (and a prize at the end). "

The least a player can go for is \\\\$1, while the most is \\\\$250-(# roster spots - 1).

A 2B/3B/HR is added on to the value of a hit, so a double is worth 5.6+2.9=8.5 points. These weights are based on wOBA/FIP, adjusted to keep pitchers and batter on a reatively level playing field. OF is any outfield position. UTIL is any batter, doesn't matter the position (kind of like a DH)."

   "source": [
    "No worries, in order to help even out the playing field a bit, here are some hints that can help you in the draft.  \n",
    "1. Try to get other people to spend their money on players that you don't want but you think that other people will. You can use ESPN draft rankings you help find discrepencies between your rankings and the ones that other people will see to help with that.  \n",
    "2. There's more than one strategy to building a team. You can blow all your money on some top tier talent and fill in the rest of your team with cheap players, or build a more balanced roster. Both can work.  \n",
    "3. There's position scarcity in baseball (some positions are deeper than others), meaning that the worst 2B on a roster might put up 1.9 points a game while the worst 1B on a roster might put up 2.5. Establishing a replacement level *wink wink* for each position can help you guage which players are more valuable just becuase of the position they play. \n",
    "4. Fantasy value does not always equal real life value. We don't care about defense and players have to play to score points. There might be some great guy sitting on an MLB teams bench, but he's not going to give you fantasy points if he's only playing every third day. Here, counting stats matter.  \n",
    "5. The league is only going to last a little over a month (the last day of points scoring will be 11:59pm on April 28th), meaning that prospects or players that won't be called up until midway through the season (Vlad Jr., Eloy) aren't realy worth drafting. You're welcome to ask if you don't know who those players are."

    "## Introduction ##\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    Looking at a players performance through the lens of statistics provides a different perspective than a subjective approach normally would. In order to guide our drafting strategty we decided to tabulate lists of what the average player in every position looks like statistically. This way we can look at the statistics of a specific player compared to an average player and guage how much they are worth in monetary terms based off of their statistics. We chose an approach like this because it will allow us to make monetarily intelligent decisions about what players we pick. If we bid for an above average player, we will know what that player is worth compared to other players statisically and will be able to bid accordingly without over-valuing or under-valuing a player. With a budget of 250 Dollars and 19 positions to fill our average player will need to cost roughly 13 dollars. \n",

    "## Data and Statistics ##\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    The first step in shaping our drafting strategy was to collect all of the relevant data and process what the average player in each position looks like statistically. In our data collection we only focused on the data points that were repesented in the overall scoring calculation for a player and we used data from the 2018 regular season. Those stats are AB, H, 2B, 3B, HR, BB, HBP, SB, and CS for batters and IP, SO, BB, HBP, HR, SV, and HLD for pitchers. We also only collected stats on batters with more than 250 plate appearances and pitchers with more than 160 innings pitched so that we our data would be representive of an average player with a significant amount of play time during the 2018 season. Below are our results of what an average player in every position will look like statistically. The score row at the bottom of these data frames represents the average ESPN fantasy score for a player at that position last year. These scores would represent what a 13.15 Dollar player at that position would look like statistically. Under that is the dollar/point row. This represents how many dollars an increase of one fantasy point at that position is worth, given that an average player is worth 13.15.\n",

    "The results of this approach are slightly atypical because they do not point to a specific set of players for the ideal roster. Instead this approach leverages the fact that in an auction style draft a team is unlikely to get all of the players the planned out in advance, and our draft will let us evaluate players on the fly so we can see how much they are worth. To do this we have created functions that let us enter a player's name and position and the function will return a dollar amount of how much that player is worth based on how much above or below the average their statistics are. \n",

    "Mookie Betts is the most valuable player out of all the data from last season. Our function puts his value at about \\$29, more than double the average player. This makes perfect sense. Aside from being one of the coolest guys in Major League Baseball, he also won the AL MVP award last year. He hit .346/.438/.640 last season. His WAR clocked in at 10.9 on Baseball Reference, first place amongst position players. He is a classic 5-tool player: he has a great arm from a difficult right field at Fenway Park, his defensive abilities in the outfield are nothing short of stellar (especially considering he's a natural second baseman), he can hit for power as his 32 homeruns show, he can hit for contact, and let's not forget he's incredibly fast. Mookie Betts being at the top of our list of most valuable players is a sign that our evaluation function is working properly."

By basing all of our decisions off the average player and how a player we are evaluating compares to the average player, we may miss opportunities to pay high amounts of money for star players who will go on to out perform what we estimate them to monetarily worth. This approach is also limited in the fact we must think and make decisions very quickly, and if we spend an above average amount of money on a player we will need to keep track of how much we have spent and buy below average players to make sure we can afford to fill all of our positions.\n",
